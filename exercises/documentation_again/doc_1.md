Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?


File::path is the class method and is called on the class itself

File#path is in instance method and is called on an instance or object of that cless type.

Think of it as creating a variable of class type 'File' and calling the instance method on that particular 'File'on that particular variable.  this isn's the correct way of understanding it technically but just run with it for now.
